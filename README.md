🌾 Paddy Disease Detection using Image Processing
This project aims to detect diseases in paddy (rice) plants using image processing techniques. It helps farmers and agricultural researchers to identify diseases early and take necessary preventive measures.

📋 Project Overview
Paddy crops are prone to various diseases that can affect crop yield. Early detection of these diseases is essential.
This system uses image processing and machine learning techniques to automatically detect paddy leaf diseases from images.
